Technologies I used:
HTML and CSS: To create a responsive and visually appealing layout.
JavaScript: For integrating API calls and managing dynamic content updates.
DOM Manipulation: To update the appearance of the website.
What made the project challenging and educational?
I implemented a responsive design optimized for different screen sizes, which enhanced my understanding of adaptive interfaces.
A function was built to fetch data from an API and display new quotes upon clicking an icon, which developed my skills in API integration.
I created hover effects and dynamic states to provide a more engaging user experience.
